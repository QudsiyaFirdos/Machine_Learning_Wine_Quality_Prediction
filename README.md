# Machine_Learning_Wine_Quality_Prediction


Predict red wine quality using the Random Forest algorithm on the UCI Wine Quality Dataset.

Steps:
1.Preprocess Data: Load, clean, and scale features.
2.Train Model: Split data and train Random Forest classifier.
3.Evaluate: Measure model accuracy on test data.
4.Predict: Estimate quality for new wine samples.
